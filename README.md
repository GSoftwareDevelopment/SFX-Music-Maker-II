# SFX Music Maker II

I opened this project to gather the most important aspects that SFX Music Maker II will feature.

# What is this project supposed to be?
An attempt to create a music program, which would use the cult 8-bit Atari computer and its possibilities offered by modern extensions such as the quadruple POKEY chip, SID and Yamaha extensions, the use of MIDI IN for program control and extended memory.

I believe that with the right approach to the issue, such a program is possible to create. In addition, it can have a simple and intuitive interface, which will make it easy to use.
